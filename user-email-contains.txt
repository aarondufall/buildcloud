Issue:

  - Issue has many asssociated emails
    - Email is either a user, or a contact

  - Want a tokened email input field

  Set the emails:
    - For a specific email, if the user exists, assign that.
      Other wise, assign a contact with the specific email.


    For a user:

     - Find user with a name, nil otherwise
     - For a contact, we first_or_create with an email.

  In the view:

    - Passes through tokens
    - Tokens are a string, with commas seperating values

    IDeally, at the value level (*under the plugin):

    - e.g. a@example.com,b@example.com,c@example.com
    - Convert into a list of emails

    - Convert list of emails into tokens
      - emails.join(",")

When I submit the issue:

   - get the emaail tokens
   - convert into a list of emails
   - assign as users, or a contact if no user is found

   When I load the form:

   - I ask for the email tokens string
   - I ask fro the list of emails
   - I build the list of emails from the users and contacts
   - I make the token from the emails
